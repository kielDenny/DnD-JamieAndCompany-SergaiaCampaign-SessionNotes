## Session Notes
### Int. Thayral’s Magical Castle - Middle of the Night
The storm woke Drod, Pauline, Miz/Val, Othwin and Jardack-Ra (not Maxi or Thayral.) As the rain pelted down on Sugi, she noticed that it was oil. Andrew (Thayral’s assistant) told Sugi tha tthey. The rest of the Party assembled downstairs to find out what was going on. Othwin said that was due to the presence of a machine god. Sugi went upstairs to wake up Valathair but found Amira first; she convinced Amira to wake Val up and they came downstairs.

Drod tried to get a sample of the rain but got caught in it. Where the oil touched his skin he felt a terrible, psychic pain. For a brief second he saw ghosts coming up from the ground and Castle Quarterstone with the Patchwork Patrol and a sickly dark six-armed being behind them. It dispatched the Patchwork Patrol to the Party.Sugi shut the door behind Drod but Pauline burst through to bring him back. 

Drod stopped her and Sugi came out to help him. She cast Healing Word which healed a few points. As Drod staggered over to take a seat he heard a voice in my head which tried to convince me to join it. Sugi examined him for metal and realized that he still had a bullet in his chest where she shot him. Thayral said that he had addtional powers for times of need; he produced three arms which perfectly opened up Drod’s chest. Sugi shaped her hand into a very small instrument and attempted to touch the metal. Sugi managed to tap the bullet and it transitioned from lead into memory metal.

Underneath Othwin’s Floating Disk, we made our way back to the house atop the facility. Jardack-Ra noticed a green wolf but didn’t think much about it. We reunited with Cappy the T-Rex. We made our way past two Star Devourers still in their containers and the vaults where there were still a Star Devourer Monster and Arch Fey. Othwin tried to open the door to the door to the facility but it didn’t work. After about a minute all of the lights began to flicker and a door opened. Othwin briefed us on the weird things that we might find inside the facility.

We walked through a few rooms. A pleseasore named Pearly met us and spoke with Othwin. Pearly used to be an Eldarin and enjoyed being a dinosaur so she transformed herself into such. She is the closest thing that facility has to a warden. We came across an amphitheater with a massive feast on the table. This was apparently the dining room of the facility. As we stopped for a moment Val cast a window through to ask for updates on breaking Pauline’s contract with the Company.

Maxi tried to control the facility with her phone and it appeared to work. A little pleaseasore hologram appeared on her phone. It said that she had administrator controls with some restrictions.
