[0:00:11] He said that Maxi was a Child of Amana who came with Sergaia who created man. Sugi convinced the man to come with them back to Turnsprock to reunite with Othwin. He left his works down there and followed them up the ladder. He said that he was down there to make contingencies for Ezerin.
[0:03:26] At the surface he questioned Drod about his origins and recognized Atrepos as the cutter of fate. He walked over to the headless dragon and began examining it. He said that back in his time dragons were only red. He followed us back up through the tunnel. He eventually said his name was Faylar the Solver who Waits for the End. He said that Ezerin was the Bringer of Dreams. Sugi tried to call Othwin on her sending stone but it didn’t go through in the cave. When we emerged he was fascinated by the rift in the skies if he made it to the closest facility at Glemaris. As the sun shone on this man, he began to de-age before the Party’s eyes. He settled on an age around Othwn’s (in his early 30s.) He said that the facility was in the very far north of the continent but he would go back to the city with them. 
[0:08:04] Sugi was finally able to connect with Othwin; although Othwin was grumpy, Sugi asked him for any good jokes. Sugi said that one of his friends said he would have some good jokes. Sugi finally said that they had Faylar with them and were coming to reunite them. Faylar took the standing stone from Sugi and excitedly planed their reunion over drinks.
[0:10:58] The Party made their way back to Matia to collect the bounty. The Quartermaster of the Guard was very impressed with what the Party did. We relayed Blitzen’s extrraplanor origins and the Quartermaster said that we could dispense justice as we saw fit. He gave us a reward of 1,000 gold total (200 apiece), 3 healing potions, a potion of jump and a bottle of fire oil. We turned over the deeds that we found and the Quartermaster said that any of the other items are an extra reward (the stones that we found and the thanks of the city.) 
[0:17:02] In the city, Miz went to the Marchant district and hawked their shield for 800 gold. Drod tried to persuade the Quartermaster to cancel the missive to recruit the Kobolds which almost got him arrested. That is where the session ended for the night.
