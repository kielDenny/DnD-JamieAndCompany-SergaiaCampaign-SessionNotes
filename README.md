# Privacy Notice
If you are not a member of Jamie's Sergaia D&D campaign, please recognize that these files are not intended for you to read or use. The notes are only intended to be used by the members of our D&D campaign and by no one else. The only reason that they are public is so that they can be retrieved by World Forge in their original file types. Please respect the privacy of our campaign players.

# Purpouse of this Repository
This repository is a drop box for past notes and summaries from Jamie's Sergaia Campaign. The intent is to put all of my session notes in one place, outside of Google Drive that can be accessed by the entire Party. Hosting the files here also makes it easy to link them into World Anvil so they can be downloaded on demand (Google Drive was not allowing that no matter my settings.) So think of this as the file drop box for the Sergaia Campaign.

# Feedback
Let me know either in the pull requests or on World Anvil if there are mistakes in the notes.

# Liscence
Please see the LICENSE.md file in this repository for the use and replcation of all materials contained within this repository.
