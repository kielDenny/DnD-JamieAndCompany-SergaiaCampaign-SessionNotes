## Session Notes
### Ext The Frizdizzleman Estate, Back Yard - Afternoon (Continuous from Last Session)
The Party started just as the battle with the possum. The noise from the courtyard woke Sugi up who landed a shot against it. Jardack-Ra cast a few spells which helped his allies. The possum attempted to bite Jardack-Ra but missed and also missed with its tail attack. Drod tried to cas Hold Creature but that failed. Maxi heard a commotion from outside then the rifle; she casually made her way outside to find the situation. She cast Immulation which did a good chunk of damage. On Val/Miz’s turn her retainers attacked first and entered spirit form. On Miz/Val’s turn she called on Ethandragal and asked that they might reach out and give the creature peace. She tried to cast Divine Intervention but it failed. We saw that the ring was formerly on the possum’s bone tail but its flesh grew over the ring

On the next round, Sugi led off with a shot which landed for another decent bit of damage and a second shot which missed. Jardack-Ra punched it for a decent bit of force damage. The possum began to bulge further and looked like it was going to grow again, gurgled then its mouth glowed red. It cast a laser beam from its mouth in an arc which hit everyone; Maxi and took 32 damage while the others took 16 damage. On its second action it tried to bodyslam Jardack-Ra and Miz which missed. Drod cast Lightning Bolt at the creature’s tail and as it tried to shift away it actually moved into a more exposed position. It landed for 56 damage; after the blow it looked like the tail was only hanging on by a bit of bone. Maxi cast Blight which the possum failed to resist and inflicted 20 damage. With that the tail slowly rotted off, severing the connection with the Impure Philosopher’s stone. It thrashed wildly which only landed against Miz for 18 damage. There was one final pulse of energy then the creature exploded which dealt 54 damage to Maxi but 27 to everyone else. 

The gout of energy exploded Jardack-Ra’s yurt that he set up in the back yard. The energy still corsed through the tail and it wriggled around. Miz came over and started hacking apart the tail to find the ring. She fairly quickly found the ring. She also cast a healing spell which healed us 33 points.


Sugi banished Miz, Drod and Pauline from the house. She went to find Pauline in her room and she overheard Pauline talking with Tallian. She overheard Tallian say that Drod was not succeeding at his task but she argued for him to remain. Tallian threatened that Drod may be removed from his post. He required Pauline to make a report every other day and he would also send a letter to detail Drod’s new assignment. He reminded Pauline that Drod was her charge and that she had to supervise him. He put her down and said that her father was the only reason that she had such an important task. He said that if she did not earn promotion soon she would not be welcome in the Company or at her father’s table. He demanded that she destroy her creature companions. That is when Sugi entered the room from outside and the feed cut off.

She tried to explain to Sugi about her family. Sugi asked if she agreed to do what they are told. She told Sugi that working for it was just a higher form of slavery. We all signed contracts that bound them to the Company. The contracts are Devil contracts seared onto their flesh. She tried to explain how her uncle was not truly evil. Sugi said that the animals were transferred to the Frizdizzleman estate but would be under her care. Sugi reached down and pet it. Sugi offered some clothes that suit her age and some rest.

Sugi bumped into Othwin on her way back from Pauline. He said that Faral left to go to Glemaris. Faral went back to see how the world changed but Othwin was concerned what it could do to his mental well-being. He said that they all had to go there right now to stop him. Othwin said that he procured an airship to take them quickly north. He told her to meet them at the travel district immediately.

Sugi walked back out of the house to find Drod using magic to clean little bits of gore. Sugi walked over and cast Mending one time on Jardack-Ra’s yurt. We all made our way to the Travel District in the Northwest of the city. 

### Ext. The Travel District - Continuous
The small area was bustling with people moving around. It took a while to move through as the newcomers did not part for Sugi as the residents of the city did. We came to an airship dock where there were two towers connected by a bridge where the ships were tied. We looked around and it took us a minute to find Othwin talking with Iorin’s daughter Nina. Iorin Mistwinter walked onto the dock and asked if we wanted to go. Jardack-Ra greeted her as if he knew her and said that he was a reincarnation of Gariar. We eventually boarded the airship piloted by Iorin. Onboard was also Farsic. So the Party took off and had a short rest as we traveled northwest.

### Ext. The Airship - Over the Next Six Hours
On the flight, Sugi talked with Othwin for a bit. Sugi asked if we would have to fight him when we found him but Othwin didn’t believe so. Thayrl was the contingency checker and would be tough to challenge. He was given special benefits by the three councils as a means of protection if the world befell a terrible fate. All limits on his power was removed; he was at maximum level at the age of 15 and he was extremely powerful. He also had to take a soul oath which requires him to save his people with ever fiber of his being. He was forbidden from ruling his people or smite his enemies unless they were existential threats. Ezerin gave him the title ‘Seaker of Dreams’ to help usher the Eldarin into a new era of prosperity. Othwin does not know how to take that Ezerin tried to kill him and what that means. He needs to speak with Thayral. He said that he needed to tell him how the 3 billon people died, how Sergaia came down and split the contents and who was left from someone who was there.

In the back of Sugi’s mind she heard the voice of Perskavir. She lamented how she could not be there for him. She warned that the facilities were dangerous and she could not have made Kaldraccus or Kornotus without them. She knew that she made a mistake when Kaldraccus said she was wrong; then she made Kronotus who said the same thing.  She tried to have them work against each other but in a way to serve the world. She originally created the Golden Core as companions for her people but Kronotus took them. She said the battle fought wiped out a massive city where the forest of Try now grows. Her life was perfect, and she lived forever but there was no horizon to cross so she made her children. When Sugi asked about the moon, Preskavir said that the moons were not for her kind. So they changed the world around them and it led to this. She warned Sugi that Kronotus’ influence was so strong that it was a bad idea that he was in Turnsprock. Sugi wondered why she was not Forged by Kronotus. Preskavir said this was very unusual because Kronotus not Kaldraccus had the power to persuade someone when they gazed upon him not Kronotus. She said that Horus was the first one was to witness Kaldraccus; he reverse engineered Kaldraccus to have more powers. She said that the King was the one who was able to exert Kaldraccus’ will on others not Kaldraccus himself. *So it seems that King Horus was the main opponent.* She said that if she took out the King then the Forged would return to who they were. She explained it all to Othwin.

Meanwhile Jardack-Ra annoyed Iorin as she piloted the ship. He tried to make it seem like he knew everything that was going on but quickly 

Drod had a conversation with Pauline at the front of the ship. Corriel said that the brand on Pauline’s chest was a high level Devil brand. Jardack-Ra cast Augury and determined that if they killed Pauline to break the contract it would not have a good result. Nina said that her mother said that the best first step is to distance themself from the one that did the contract, essentially to be her. Jardack-Ra cast Divination to ask a god how to break the contract. He asked the Fates “what is the best course of action to safely remove a Devil contract?” The Fates responded that the brands are etched deep into the soul, each brand a letter in a story that needs to ends. You need both copies of the letter, the one in the soul and the one in the book. The bearer is held to the story of the designer. Drod knew that this was the employee ledger.

After that Miz walked off and spoke with her retainers. Coriel said that they could go back to the Nine but it would take some time. She asked if she could find a library that contained information about such contracts. Amir helped Corriel transcend back to the Nine Hells to look for information.

We traveled for a few hours until we reached the Daggerbacks. We descended from the Dauntless via rope ladders.

### Ext. The Daggerback Mountains, Near Quarterstone - Continuous
We found ourselves sanding in the mountains along a road. Sugi instantly recognized that it was near the house where they found Teller. As we came to the house we heard a sound of a very large being. We saw the T-Rex that the Party released six months ago. It recognized Jardack-Ra and rolled over to allow him to scratch its belly.

Miz cast Locate Creature and determined that Thayral was 995 feet away. On our way we passed a fire extinguished in the last day. Eventually we came to a figure in the distance. Othwin was the first to get to him as he wrote in his book. Thayral and Othwin talked for a bit as Drod tried to read his thoughts (but failed.) He invited Othwin into his sanctum to ‘go for a couple of rounds.’ We all came into the sanctum that was Othwin and Thayral’s ‘club house.’ 

Thayral summoned a servant to help clean up the dusty Medieval man-cave and it turned out to be a Golden Child named Andrew. Sugi asked if they were cousins and Andrew did not know. Sugi touched Andrew with her Sugornite arm and there was a pulse between the two. Immediately Andrew felt much better and more like himself. He said that he lived in stand by but was paid to keep the place clean; he sends the money to his sister in Archivus. We could see Andrew’s eyes and mouth move in a way that Sugi’s did not. He cast Prestidigitation on the entire bar and made drinks for the Party. He said that his designation from Krototos was to be Theyral’s friend whereas some of his friends had tasks like to be a diver to recover things from the sea. He said that some like Kenneth could reject this designation and find their own true designation. Theyral asked how a Paraline was but Othwin said that she was long dead and looked very hurt. Theyral also asked about Preskavir and Othwin said that she was with Sugi. Othwin said that was why his jokes were no longer up to snuff. Othwin told Thayral about the history of the world up to that point. Andrew offered us beds for the night. 

Miz, Amira, Jardack-Ra, Drod and Pauline made their way back to the facility to protect it from other people. About half way there, they noticed that the small campfire was re-lit and three people were around it. Jardack-Ra took the lead and introduced himself to the party of a Human woman named Elaine, a male Lizadrfolk named Manuel and a Half-Elven man named Auri. When Jardack-Ra went into his bit about the world ending Auri said that the world already ended. They were going to a town in Asmary called Kurrix and they were the protectors. Auri said that a long time ago (three months) he and his friends headed west to Quarterstone and they saw the cracks in the sky. They took that as a sign that they needed to go home and ask what it meant. On their way they ran into a massive storm. It took them a week to get home instead of a day. When they arrived they found out that the sky broke and their entire town got worried, scared, looked for help and someone else came to the town first. The person said they brought salvation from the Broken Sky, that the world was ending and the only thing they can do was follow the Matraya into the path of knowledge and they killed themselves. He looked down on Jardack-Ra with hate in his eyes and told him how they came to a city of corpses. He said that it made them realize that they had to make sure that it didn’t happen to anyone else; they realized that as long as there were people like Jardack-Ra, they would put them into the ground. They also said that they are going to pay themselves handsomely for ridding the world of people like Jardack-Ra. 

At that point, a long-haired Elven woman emerged and used Detect Thoughts on Jardack-Ra. She read the normal drivel then the whole Atropos knowledge of the fates took over her mind. She freaked out and was very confused by what was going on. The rest of the Party (at this gathering) stepped into the firelight to reveal ourselves. Suddenly there was a gnome holding a dagger at Jardack-Ra’s throat. Jardack-Ra Misty Stepped away from the Gnome. Eventually the adventurers offered the Party 4,500 gold for Atrepos which Drod greedily eyed up. We negotiated a deal where they would kill Jardack-Ra and we would take the body (and resurrect him unknown to them.) However, they summoned a massive Fire Elemental. Miz banished Jardack-Ra as we entered combat.

Miz was able to banish the fire elemental that ended combat.

Drod looked around and realized that the only sign of the party were a bit of singed hemlock. The gold turned out to only be about 500 gold coins and 4,000 chocolate coins. From there Sugi and Maxi returned to the sanctum. There Sugi checked on the two sleeping Eldarin who appeared to be doing fine.

We reunited at the castle and turned in for the night. As we prepared to sleep, Sugi watched as the cracks in the sky began to glow. When they began to shimmer more and more she felt that there was something wrong. Suddenly there was a shaking in the sky and suddenly the cracks began to disappear. There was a sound like a rush of wind that grew louder until it was overwhelming. The wind blew past him and knocked her from her feet. She saw an enormous storm rulling in from every direction. She felt that the castle returned and Kaldraccus was back on Sergaia. That is where we ended the session.
