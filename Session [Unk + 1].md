### Vaccius Imperium
Theocratic, authoritarian state. 
They travel between planes of existence but about half disappeared
They received the ability not from their god but from a magical person from another plane.

## Where we left off
We rested at the Frizdizzleman Estate. After Atropos and Puss in Boots departed Lady Açi Rockspeaker and Judah Eld came to the estate. Apparently the old king of Lornas died and the only legitimate heir turned out to be Willard Wise. Judah and Açi Rockspeaker were targeted by assassins.

## This Session
### Int. Dining Room, The Frizdizzleman Estate, Aranas, The Northeastern Continent, Sergaia, The Material Plane - Evening, About an Hour After Last Session
Açi, Judah and the Party are drinking tea together in the dining room. We discussed the assassinations against Willard. ==**Quest:** 1) Stop the Assassins 2) find leads on the assassins.== They were hired by an unknown entity.

The city has been tense due to the upcoming festivities for the 400th anniversary of the founding of the city.

Sugi gave Mizriel a Sugornite hand. The effects of the Sugornite sped up her mind allowed her to experience some extra-sensory abilities. Valathor took over Miz’s mind, ran out of the room, up to a gazebo and communed with his demon-god. 


### Ext. The Roof of a Nearby Gazebo - Continuous
On the roof of the gazebo Val began talking with what at first looked like a child that was apparently a very powerful demon god. It told Val that what he saw coming off of Maxi and Drod was planar energy emanating from them. He told Val that Drod will likely succumb to the temptation to planes walk and be devoured by the beings that live between realities. The others used a rod of diamond and gold to prevent the constant urge to jump between planes of existence. The demon god reveled that it had 14 names and that the number of names were associated with their level of power. Apparently Valathor has 9 names but can only remember the one. Val might be able to see the ghosts that follow Sugi around due to the presence of Sugornite on Miz’s body. It would only take a snap to get Miz to realize the potential of her power and Val can do that at any time. It is also entirely up to Val if they want to prevent Drod from being devoured. The demon god departed, Miz relinquished control and Val returned inside to her friends.


### Int. Dining Room, The Frizdizzleman Estate - Continuous
Açi told what she knew about assassins. One of their greatest translator constructs were struck down in the under-city near the river. Part of their core that governed languages was missing and presumed to be taken. People disappeared in the Under-City and Açi was attacked three days ago by a flesh golem created from the disappeared. They appeared normal for a distance which makes them rare and dangerous. They gained information from the Uncrowned Eye that this group plans to do something during the festivities.

The Party decided to chase down leads on the assassins. Miz tried to locate Katsumi but she was too far out of range. ==**Quest:** Revive the dead Warforged.== Sugi requested to see the remains of the dead forged’s core to try and retrieve some memories from it. Açi, Judah and their crew left while Rose and Willard retired to their room.

Roxi communed with the last memory of the Warforged. The forged encountered a pair of twin goblins (one male and one female) in the Under-City. They spoke with the forged for a moment and they divulged that they were part of Fire-Fist Acquisitions. One goblin drew on the forged who also drew their gun. Suddenly a wall exploded, a massive construct appeared piloted by one of the goblins. It ripped off the head of the forged and the memory ended. The spirit of the forged continued speaking with Roxi. It said that the only one who could do that was the Core Hunter who died 40 years ago. They remembered the Core Hunter being large and imposing so it could have been related. Apparently a goblin named Jarco Grimwood has such a mechanical suit or would know about it. The forged chose to not move on to the Raven Queen and wait to see if they could recover the language part of their core. ==**Quest:** Recover the Forged’s language core.== The forged said its name was Speakin’ Jack or Say-Jack.

### Int. Drod’s Room, The Frizdizzleman Estate - Continuous
Val and Drod talked about extra planar travel. Drod now knows about the Demon Lord told Val. As they talked Drod blinked out between dimensions. He saw an inky blackness with some wisps of color swirling around him. All of a sudden there was a large eye then he blinked back into the Prime Material. The two finished talking about planar travel and they went their separate ways.

During the night, Maxi had a nightmare. She was the forged and when it got its head ripped off she yelled out which drew Sugi and Miz to the room. After reassuring them, the two left and Maxi went back to bed. After she went back to sleep, she had the nightmare again then she dreamed one of her own dreams of a concert but the forged was there and the goblins too. Sam, one of her friends, put her hand on Maxi’s shoulder but it startled her. In her dream she met a man (who was not in the original memory) who said his name was Kaldraccus. He wanted to bring peace to her troubled mind. He said that he was made to force the world into order while Kronotus brings stagnation, war and disillusion. He seemed to think that if one died then the other would take over their positions and power.
