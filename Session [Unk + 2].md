## This Session
### Int, Frizdizzleman Estate - Morning
The Party was in the dining room of the estate. We went out into the world to find leads on the assassins. Maxi told us about her nightmare and we decided to track down the two goblins.

Miz went off and tried to find a servant. They asked about pest control to find some dead animals. The Forged pointed them to the refuse pit in the Undercity where the dead are incinerated. 

### Ext. The Undercity - Shortly Later
We met a guard before we made our way down the stairs. She warned us that there were fewer guards in the Undercity and we should avoid it. I know of a tavern in the Old Town called the Dead End where I might get some tavern.

We met and talked with a hooper who gave us some information about the murders. It happened in the Slum District around a house of ill-repute. There are four Fire Fist people running around the Old City but he has no idea where they are.

We made our way toward the Dead End. We encountered some *Eternal Mourners* who are the taboo grave diggers of the city. While visiting the Grave District they become compelled to stay, live in the district and bury the dead. I know to give them a wide birth. Maxi sensed that the one Mourner was covered in ghosts, clinging to her. Maxi created a ball of brilliant blue light that exorcised the spirits with the help of her staff and her phone. 

Maxi freed the person named Claire from the spirits. She said that the last remembered was the coup which was 70 years ago. She went to the Grave District when her husband died (hence the impetuous.) Atropos saw that the lines of her fate showed Claire reuniting with someone in the Upper City.

### Int. The Dead End - Continuous
I reunited with Divin the proprietor of the Dead End. He told us about Sayjack. The Assassins contracted the Twins along with Sammy and Davis. They have been contracting out to Fire Fist to get very specific parts from around the city. So far they have stolen a magical compass from the Adventurer’s Guild. One of the assassins is a female Gith not associated with the Company. Sayjack was in the Undercity to help a specific client translating for a man with a specific taste in women, a rare companion. He was assaulted on the way back. The lady who he was going to meet was a Fay which he did not know. He suggested to ask at the House of Pleasures.

Drod involuntarily transported himself to a bar in Philadelphia. He talked with some patrons at a bar who were drinking and watching an Eagles game. I cast Hypnotic Pattern on them to assuage their fears and asked some basic questions about where I was.

So Divin revealed himself to Val as a fellow, powerful demon by pouring him a shot of Demonvies (demon vitality.) They spoke about their names and why they would help a group like the ones they traveled with. They described what was happening as the circle closing around the world. He offered to take Val from Miz as it could be beneficial to him. He said that the people possessed at the Quarterstone Castle are weakest at the heart and that could kill them as if they were a normal being. He was not sure if they could loosen the control over the beings. Divin said that he worked for a group who had eyes everywhere, they existed in Sergia for hundreds of years called the Uncrowned Eye. **OUR ANCESTERAL WEAPON HAS 10 TOTAL SPIRIT POINTS.** 

### Ext. The Grave District - Continuous
The Party left the Dead End to visit the Grave District. As soon as we entered, Sugi, Atropos and Drod felt very weighed down. We heard a singing that called to us from the graves of the dead. 

Sugi used her sending stone to communicate with Teeth. They spoke with the Raven Queen about the situation in the Grave District. She said that she would take care of the situation. She also said that Atropos should expect their Mayar brethren to deal with the current situation of the world. Teeth said that Krobis and a group of other Reapers would be around to liberate the spirits of the Grave District and shepherd their souls to the Raven Queen.

We continued on to the incinerator. We easily found and picked up a dead possum for Miz to take up.

### Ext. Ms. Bella Blue’s Charm School, The Slums - Continuous
We left the Grave District for the house of ill repute in the Slums: Ms. Bella Blue’s Charm School for Young Girls. It is a veritable manor compared to the surrounding houses. There are various women of various races hanging out of the windows. One of the girls told us that if we wanted to know about a Fay that we should head inside and talk with Ms. Bella but she was unavailable for some time.

We decided to stake out the place to see who she was talking with. Maxi and I went inside the bar to see what was going on while the others waited outside to see who came and went. 

Outside the bar, Miz witnessed two well dressed individuals exit the bar. Out front Sugi saw to well dressed people (one a goblin and a Firbolg) come down from upstairs. The Firbolg said the Boss liked to talk with people. The two out front confronted Sugi and Atropos but they backed down. Sugi and Atropos stayed outside. 

### Int. Ms. Bella Blue’s Charm School - Concurrent
Maxi and I came inside and I ordered a drink while Maxi ordered a lemonade. Maxi asked the bartender if anyone died in the vicinity recently. They said that they did not know about such a thing (which we noticed was a lie.) We watched a busty Dwarven woman arm in arm with Tallian Binghamton concluding a business deal. It seems that the Company made a deal to supply ‘workers’ to their establishment. Drod noticed that was who they were and watched from down the bar. 

Maxi saw Binghamton slap the goblin guard for not staying outside. She ran toward him to accost him; I ran after him but could not catch up. Miz cast Banishment against Maxi who transported her to a harmless demi-plane. I introduced myself to Binghamton and apologized for my friend. We talked outside about my business proposition of exploiting multiple planes of existence.

In the bar Maxi got several text messages to “help fate!” over and over again. She told Verkati to please get their coffee to go. As she left the phone told her directions to find Sugi but the map was still of New Jersey. She ran in the direction of Sugi.

### Ext. The Slums - Concurrently
Sugi felt something wrap around her. It said that she was not done here as metal arms wriggled around her. It pulled her away from the tavern at a fast speed, through a house which was destroyed. She landed on her feet and whipped her gun out at the being. She saw two glowing eyes as it threw shrapnel at her and she cast Sanctuary on herself which caused it to miss. Frederick climbed out of the dark toward her. He said that he should come back with him and Frida. Sugi fired a memory metal bullet at him which struck a metal arm but blew off into shrapnel. He landed one attack but another missed. He then lunged at Sugi who cast heat metal on herself which burned Freddy when he tried to grab her. They went back and forth dealing damage. Sugi cast Shape Metal and tried to form the metal over his face to block his breathing. He jumped back, pulled what looked like a rope from his back and ignited the rope. He said Sugornite could melt and used the flaming whip to ensnare Sugi. Freddy said he had been given a task to bring her into the fold or kill her. She pulled her Tiger’s Eye, used Sharpshooter and Dead Eye shot to hit him in the heart but it missed as he missed on his attack. Sugi shot Freddy in the heat which did not seem to phase him too much. He let out a shreak as his flesh tore and metal replaced his flesh. When his claw came into contact with Sugi’s sugornite hand, he was able to shake it off. Sugi put her hand on her face, which caused him to shriek out as he tried to shake it off.

Atropos ran at top speed through the slums toward the sound of combat. He eventually found Sugi but a metal arm close-lined him to the ground. It was a goblin a mech suit. It ran towards him Atropos dropped his disguise which revealed his true being. Atropos attacked with his shimmering blades of fate. Atropos sheared off one of the Mech’s arms. The goblin mech then came at Atropos which he blocked with Silvery Barbs. A voice called out from the dark and another Goblin came out. It turns out their names were Radio (the male) and Expa (the female.) Expa drew a pair of obsidian daggers and lunged at Atropos which hit but he resisted the poison. When Maxi appeared, she cast Summon Elemental. Shortly later Drod and Miz also approached this battle which caused the goblins to flee. Expa flung out daggers which struck Maxi but missed Atropos and created a cloud of smoke. They did notice the direction that the goblins were headed which allowed Maxi to send her poltergeist against while Atropos cast fly on himself to chase them. Maxi’s poltergeist caused the gutter the goblins grappled to break and caused them to tumble to the ground.

Drod and Miz came to a fork. They decided to split up as Drod went toward Atropos and Maxi while Miz went toward Sugi.

Before Miz arrived, Freddy tried to end Sugi. She heard Kaldraccus’ voice in her head as Freddy tried to corrupt her. Concurrently Sugi tried to corrupt Freddy with her Sugornite. Val arived as the two looked almost fused together. He cast Banishment on Freddy which failed. Sugi and Freddy engaged in a back-and-forth contest which seemed to be evenly matched. Val took advantage of this situation and cast Inflict Wounds on Freddy which broke open the curses of Freddy’s machine and exposed Freddy’s heart. Sugi reached forward with her Sugornite hand and touched his heart which caused him to fall backward and scrabble away from her. The metal began to fling off of the being until what was left of Freddy remained. His heart slowed. The pieces of metal formed together, shrieked and ran off on their own. On his last breaths, he said that Frida was not fully converted. His last words were that he loved his daughters but he loved himself more. He said Kronotus be dammed and Kaldraccus preserve you. At the end of the battle, Sugi was greviously wounded so Val cast Cure Wounds on her for some bit of restoration.

Drod came upon a blithe Gith woman wearing all black clothes. The two verbally sparred for a minute until Drod tried to cast Dominate Person. It was successful but it allowed her to establish a mind link which controlled Drod. She commanded him to lie down and stay there until she came back. She confronted Atropos who stood down and allowed her to retrieve her goblins. Atropos did not attempt to stop her and they walked back past Drod. She said that his friends could allow him to move if they said “petty petty pepperoni” then produced a gold and diamond rod and walked into a wall. The party reconvened around Drod and allowed him to move again. They shared their experiences, including the death of Freddy and what they learned from the encounter. 

### Int. Ms. Bella’s - Shortly Later
We walked back to Ms. Bella’s to heal up, get coffee and ask about the Fay person. We found out that person was Netta, a Pixy who flitted down and landed on the bar. Verkati translated our questions into Sylvan and Netta said that she was going to have an evening with a Dragonborn named Stene. They needed language support so they hired Sayjack who got up and left in the middle of their act but he never came back. She said that she saw two goblins and a scary Gith lady who collected weird things around the city. She mentioned that she was making a homunculus assassin to do the real bidding.
