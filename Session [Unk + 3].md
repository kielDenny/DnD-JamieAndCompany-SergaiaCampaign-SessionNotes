### Events from Last Session
* The Party started last session at the Frizdizzleman Estate in Turnsprock in Aranas.
* We decided to investigate leads about a potential assassination of King Willard Wise in the Undercity.
* We talked with a hooper who pointed us to a brothel in the Slum District
* On our way to the Dead End (a tavern that Drod thought could give us more information) we encountered an *Eternal Mourner*. Maxi realized that spirits possessed the Mourner exorcised them thus freeing the woman. [^1]
* We stopped at the Dead End for some drinks and some information. Divin told us about a Gith woman, two goblins and four members of Fire Fist Acquisitions that were active in the Undercity. Later he revealed to Valathair that he was a powerful demon lord and offered him a deal of sorts should he wish to separate from Miz.
* After the Dead End we went to the Grave District. Atropos, Drod and Sugi were almost possessed by the spirits there but Maxi warded them off. Sugi then contacted Teeth and the Raven Queen who would send some reapers to cleanse the district. Miz successfully picked up some carcasses for her experiments.
* After the Grave District we investigated Ms. Bella’s. There we witnessed Tallian Binghamton cutting a business deal with Ms. Bella. Maxi tried to prevent Binghamton from hitting one of his guards which Miz stopped by banishing her. This allowed Drod, Miz and Tallian to leave the brothel and talk business. Drod revealed that he could planar travel but disappointed Binghamton by not revealing how to do so and left. Drod and Miz went in the direction of the combat but split off in the direction of the different battles.
* While staking out the brothel, Sugi was yanked away by what turned out to be the twisted remains of Freddy Frizdizzleman. The two fought an intense battle in a distant alleyway. The two tried to corrupt each other but ultimately Sugi prevailed (aided at the end by Miz.) Sugi tried to heal Freddy by touching his heart with her Sugornite hand but it ultimately killed him. He was unrepentant of his actions to the end.
* Atropos tried to rescue Sugi but first Radio in his mech suit then Expa blocked his path. Atropos easily overcame them both around the time that Sugi defeated Freddy.
* Drod encountered the unnamed Gith woman alone in an alley. The woman turned Drod’s own spell against him and forced him to lie still until his friends returned. The Gith woman then continued on to face Atropos who was rightfully terrified of her power. The woman collected her goblin servants, left without a fight from Atropos and disappeared between planes. 
* The Party reconverted around Drod, freed him then returned to Ms. Bella’s to recuperate. There, we spoke with Netta about the night Sayjack died. We learned that she saw the Gith woman and her Goblins collecting weird objects to create a homunculus who would be the true assassin of King Wise.

[^1]: The woman had been in a trance for at least 70 years but she did not age nor did she know that any time had passes. She became possessed when she ventured into the Grave District to mourn her then recently deceased husband.

# How to Edge with Your Sheers
## This Session
### Int. Ms. Bella’s - Night
We took a restless night’s rest. Sugi was tormented by killing her uncle. Drod mulled over his domination by the Gith woman and spontaneously teleported. Atrepos struggled with being afraid for the first time. All three got rest but gained a point of exhaustion. Verkatti showed us to private rooms (i.e. stalls that conformed to our particular interests.) 

While the Party slept, Miz went back to the bar and spoke with Verkatti to speak with the woman who was able to heal up when attacked viciously (that they saw during the last session.) Miz/Val went to see Missy in her room, a curvaceous, blonde human woman. Val came out to examine Missy; they noticed a very sterile room with a drain in the middle of the room, a simple bed, iron bed posts nailed to the floor and blades hanging on the walls. Val noticed that the woman had no scars and her skin was pristine, almost unmarked by any blemishes and no hair on her body except for her head. Val performed a medical exam on her. Missy produced a bunch of medical instruments and allowed Val to perform a simple exam on her. Miz noticed Missy slightly shift in front of her. She said that her dad was infected by a fungal pudding. She was born a normal human baby but she was part fungal pudding and was now 60% pudding. Normally she looks unremarkable, short, human. She said that her father turned into an actual monster, tried to kill her and was killed by the village. It was a particularly nasty type of pudding that he picked up in the Underdark. She could turn off the pain receptors all over her body so she couldn’t really feel anything. The only thing that can’t be changed is her spinal cord. 

Val asked about the previous girl (a Southlands employee). The girl babbled on about the boss, business dealings, loving/hating the boss. She said some weird stuff about sex. Val said that he appreciated the mind of Missy’s and they formed a little appreciation for one another. Missy had been doing this for a long time and didn’t age. She was working during the coup (75-80 years ago) she estimated she was about 112 years old.


### Int. Ms. Bella’s - Morning
Val/Miz returned by early morning and decided to reanimate Freddy’s head. The party asked if he knew about the Gith woman which he did not. Maxi asked Drod about something which was the 2nd question. Sugi asked where Frida was which he said she was kept safe in a dungeon. Miz asked if he was involved in the assassination which he was not involved. He heard about rogue groups that would like to assassinate Willard but he thought it was probably a usurper.

As Drod came back to his room he was greeted with a petit Tiefiling woman. She wore the uniform of the company and carried a ledger. She said she needed to keep an eye on me. She was Tallian’s niece Pauline. She was there to observe and report on me. She seemed nice and interested in every part of my day.

As Maxi woke up, she found that the fire dog she summoned never dissipated. She spoke with the dog and it seemed to understand her. They went to the bar to get coffee and biscuits. Drod, Pauline and Ilsen-Arent came down and joined the group. After some coffee, Pauline got really hyper and Drod went for a walk with her to show her around town.

After Drod left, Atrepos came down to speak with Netta. He said that he did not want to have sex with Netta but wanted to ask her some questions. Netta said that she was open to having relations with Atrepos but didn’t know how that would work. Netta drank a potion that allowed her to speak Common (from her native Sylvan). She thought that he was impotent but they were having different conversations. They had a long conversation about using their sheers in public, delaying using them, how to edge. 

### Int. Largo’s House - Shortly Later

We walked through the slums with Verkatti to a square, metal building that they knew about. Some goblins answered the door and allowed us to enter as Verkatti went back to the bar. The goblin man, named Largo, was Expla and Radio’s father. He had no idea where they were. He knew the Gith woman, she was asking about: a bunch of strange ingredients. The mech was stolen by Expa from Largo. He would reward us if we brought it back in one piece. He said to turn it off, at the back of the suit is an inhibitor bolt that can be disconnected which would disable the suit. He thought that his son modified the suit to prevent the bolt from easily being taken out.

He went out and got his elderly father, Djarko, probably in his late 80s or 90s (really old for a goblin.) They were staying with Z, who kept good care of them, they were staying at the Bridge and Bunk in the upper city. He needed a reactor to be powered up more and helped him to create a second reactor (that was about a week ago.) We came up with a plan for them to travel out of the city for a bit to convince the two that they were dead in the hopes of flushing out the twins. We picked up some spare arms to convince the kids that we had them hostage. 

### Int. The Bridge and Bunk, The Upper City - Later
We traveled back into the Upper City to find that preparations for the festival were well along. We went to the area where the Bridge and Bunk where we did some reconnaissance. A guard told us that Ivar Boradbard offered a reward for a missing watch that made its wearer invisible. We split the party with Miz/Val and Atrepos going to investigate their room while Maxi, Sugi and Drod went to capture the goblins.

The goblin group went into the inn and asked about the two goblins. We told the Firbolg attendant that they had their grandfather and that they needed to come down. Drod took a position behind the door, Sugi took a position front and center, Maxi stood beside her and Pauline began to write a contract under the table. They walked in the door and Drod slammed it behind them. We successfully intimidated the shit out of the two goblins and they were fully convinced we had their grandfather. They said Z was a smart woman who gave them a job and promised she would take them to a world where goblins rule. They said Z was upstairs waiting for them. 

The upstairs group went to the door and found that it was locked. By the time Drod messaged them, they already burst down the door. They encountered Z (who thought that it was the goblins.) When the door came down Miz/Val noticed the language core, a few trinkets, a large blood-red apple, weapons and the mech suit behind the table. Z drew a simple oak staff and confronted them. Miz, still invisible, crept around and took a bite out of the apple. She turned and saw the bite taken out of the apple. The woman dashed toward the table, she cast a spell on the objects which made them disappear. She asked why they were there but they did not give an answer back. When asked what she was doing, she said that she was doing what needed to be done to serve her masters. She said that she was not supposed to kill the lot of them but she needed to kill King Willard Wise. If we got in the way she was able to grievously harm them. Miz cast banishment on her that took her to Z’s home plane of existence (for one minute.) During the interlude, she ran over to the bolt on the suit. Atrepos smote the covering and grabbed the bolt before the two ran.

Concurrently, the conference room group interrogated the goblins. They said that Z worked for some very scary people that were not from around here. As Expla was about to sign a Gith arm reached through the planes of existence and grabbed Expla into another plane. That left Radio who we convinced to sign the contract. At that time we saw the upstairs party run by and we all ran out into the street where we almost ran into a marching band troop.

### Ext. The Upper City - Continuous
The Bird of Acki Rockspeaker came down and told her that Acki needed to speak with them. We reunited and shared what happened. We walked as a group back to the estate. On the way Sugi told us that there were no unicorns in the area. At the estate, Acki, Judah and Willard waited for us. Willard said that he was the happiest he had ever been and wanted to have another child. Drod asked Atrepos what would happen if Willard were to die. Willard’s thread was quite long but there was a thin, frayed area and an unnatural kink as if someone were holding it. He began to get the idea that Willard was supposed to die with the book and things were getting weird with the fates. He noticed that Sugi’s thread was gilded now and in the future splits into three. We turned around to see that Radio was gone. Acki said that she knew about the Needle Points that have access to platinum thread (needed by the spell.) We figured out that the tree tended by McGuffin was an apple tree tended with love. 

We talked for a while until there was a knock at the door. Two short, black, blithe women came in before a human woman in her late 60s wearing a purple and gold gown. She said her name was Lady Daniella and was the leader of the Needlepoint  Guild. We asked if they had any platinum thread missing. Lady Daniella said that she knew of a horrible procedure: a cross between alchemy and golomancy that would produce an awful creature. She said it would make the assassin pass as a human until it got close enough to the target. Maria returned and told Lady Daniella that half of the supply of platinum thread was missing. She was very incensed by the theft of her product and would very much like to speak with the thief. She said she would be at the concert and be willing to ‘stitch a suit jacket that the thief could not get out of.’ She would also make something for each of us if we were successful. She made her exit and said we would meet again soon. If we need anything her girls and her would be ready. She said the code will be harp strike fire. They left the area for us to talk.

Judah discovered that they left a patch behind on the cloth that appeared to be alive. Coffee burned the patch before it could report back. We talked about heightened security at the concert. We took a long rest and decided to resume preparations tomorrow morning. That was the end of the session.
