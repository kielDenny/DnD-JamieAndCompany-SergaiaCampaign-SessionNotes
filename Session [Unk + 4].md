## Events from Last Session
* The Party spent a restless night at Ms. Bella’s in the Slum District of the Undercity of Turnsprock in Aranas.
* Miz/Val investigated Missy’s regenerative abilities and found out that she was 60% fungal pudding. They also learned a bit more about the Company woman who visited Missy the other day.
* Early in the morning, the Party reanimated Freddy’s severed head. We found out that Freddy did not know the Gith woman, that Frida was safe in a dungeon, that he was not involved in the assassination plot against Willard Wise and he thought that a usurper likely hired them.
* In the morning, Pauline found the Party, introduced herself and said that she would be observing Drod.
* The Party reunited at the bar at Ms. Bellas to begin their day proper.
* Maxi found that the fire familiar she summoned the previous day did not disappear and that it was likely her familiar.
* Atropos and Netta had a long, productive conversation about using their sheers and how to edge.
* After breakfast Verkatti took the Party to Largo’s house to potentially find Expa and Radio.
* Largo told the Party how to disable the mech suit and that the twins were staying with Z in the upper city.
* The Party convinced Largo and Djarko to take a trip to Matia for a few days.
* The Party went to find Expa and Radio with a plan to lure them away from Z by convincing them that we kidnapped their grandfather.
* The Party split into two groups with Miz/Val and Atrepos in Team Sneaky Sneak and Drod, Maxi and Sugi in Team Faux Ransom Negotiations.
* Team Ransom Negotiations passed a message up to Expa and Radio that their grandfather was waiting from them in a meeting room of the inn.
* Team Sneaky Sneak went up to the (hopefully) vacated room but found Z was still there.
* Team Ransom Negotiations confronted the Goblin twins and mostly subdued 
* Team Sneaky Sneak broke into the room to find Z still inside. Miz took a bite from an apple (a component of Z’s spell) then the three fought.
* Miz banished Z back to her home plane for one minute which allowed them to disable the Goblin’s mech suit (which was in the room.)
* Concurrently Drod drew up a contract that would force the twins to serve the Party in exchange for the release of their family.
* Before the Goblins signed, Z grabbed Expa and took her into another plane of existence but left Radio behind.
* Radio signed the contract from himself but also Expa and thus agreed to help the Party.
* After that, the Party reunited and Açi summoned them all to the Frizdizzleman Estate.
* Once there we reunited with Açi, Willard and Judah but lost Radio.
* Atropos observed that Willard’s fate was unusual and kinked; he was unsure if Willard would live or die in the coming days.
* Açi summoned the Needlepoint Guild (a group of assassins in the city with access to the platinum thread needed by Z to complete her golem.)
* Lady Daniella eventually realized that half of her supply of platinum thread was missing (presumably stolen by Z).
* Lady Daniella offered her support to our protection of Willard and wanted to personally confront Z for her theft.
* The Party discussed plans then took a long rest to finish the session.

## [Session Name]
### Int. Frizdizzleman Estate - Morning
The day started with McGuffin meeting with Sugi in her room. He said that Miz was gone as of this morning. Their bed was missing and it smelled of sulfur. It seemed that they were summoned back to the Underdark by their master. McGuffin also said that there were several birds waiting outside the house from the messengers of the Triumverate.

The rest of the party was gathered in the sitting room having a hearty breakfast. Pauline tore into all of the plates of food in front of her (at Drod’s expense). We talked about our pasts and found out a little about Pauline’s survival of the fittest upbringing. At the end of the breakfast Sugi shared that Miz was gone.

After some time Willard, Rosemary and Açi came to continue planning. Ace later joined the planning committee. Ace said that there hasn’t been communication from the Dovesong and scouts have not come back. The Tamturnian government is going to work on that issue and Zash may go there himself to address this. Merchants who traveled there disappeared and all travel has stopped. The Lunar Claw have left.

Açi rehashed a plan to use body-doubles to make it look like they were unprotected. It seemed that our only option was to sit back and let it happen. We decided this was the only way to get what we wanted so we set out to get disguises. McGuffin brought in four Scrolls of Jump which would allow us to jump over the crowd.

In our down time, Maxi used her ability to contact Frida. We learned that she didn’t know about the assassinations. She was in Quarterstone Dungeon. She could see a strange whirl of light but didn’t know which plane. She said that Kaldraccus tried to make the castle a facility like the old Eldarin facilities to completely control their reality. She said they were in a bubble over the Shaddowfell. She said that they tried to make her build things but they were not successful. She lost three fingers trying to resist. Frida saw Orn about a week ago to begin endevors on the Material Plane. She thought they were trying to find the Party. Graham headed north to finish some business with Lord Maxwell. 

Maxi went out to speak with 

Drod went out to find a magical rod to tie Z to this plane. Pauline and I came into a very busy workshop. The Tiefling clerk produced a golden rod and a bin of rough diamonds. Drod had to procure 900 gold from the Company with Pauline’s help. The rod would be ready just before the concert. Pauline was visibly shaken so Drod comforted her and bought her a Displacer Kitten.

The next day, the Party donned disguises and made their way to the concert. On the boxes above the stage we could see the principal targets wearng wiggling or slightly moving, living thread. Everyone took their seats as the sun began to set and a Warforged woman took the stage. A similar woman ripped apart the other woman and took the stage (Laleia 420). After some time, a rifle shot went off and a girl with Tallian appeared to be shot. It appeared that Expa took the shot and Atrepos jumped to intercept her. 

She said that Radip was on and there was a scream in the middle of the crowd. A large suit of armor appeared in the crowd to shouts of shock and panic. Expla took a shot at Atrepos and missed. Maxi threw a chair at Tallian and gas lit him into believing it was the the mech. Drod blinded Radio with Blindness and moved to intercept Z as she moved to attack Willard. Sugi took two shots with her Tiger’s Eye at the mech; the first missed but the second hit. Atrepos cast command on Expla to lay down but it failed. The golem (blinded) shot randomly into the air. On his second action he tried to wipe away the blindness and actu ally rolled out of it. Expla took a second shot against Atrepos and missed. Maxi tried to hit the creature but missed. Drod continued to concentrate on Z while he held his action. On Atrepos’ turn he rolled a crit and dealt max damage on her. It forced Z to appear next to her. Radio ran toward Atrepos and swung its hands against him. All of a sudden a mostly nude woman appeared, stitched together, her left hand was a silver stump of magic. The Golem snapped Judah’s neck and began moving toward Willard and Rose. Rose used some her living weapon power to stop it to the best of her ability. Drod cast Charm Person on the Golem which didn’t work as he suspected; it asked for Zeeley. On Z’s turn she struck out at Atrepos with a clawed gauntlet. Sugi ran forward and cast Sanctuary on Willard which seemed to work. She then took a shot against the Golem which missed. Atrepos used his sheers to end Expa’s life. He then cast Hex on Z as a bonus then attacked twice. He used a smite against Z for 60 total damage. On Radio’s turn, he struck down at Arepos for 28 damage (leaving him at 8 hp.) On the Golem’s turn, it tried to move past Drod but he cast Lightning Bolt on it for 28 damage and caused its arm to fall off. Maxi tried to cast reanimate dead on the Golem’s limbs which only worked for a second. Drod cast Lightning Bolt which caused the Golem and Z to both drop down. Atrepos continued to go ham on Z doing a ton of damage, each of which landed and caused blood to run out of mouth. She teleported to right behind Pauline. Drod Misty Stepped down, held a dagger up to Z’s neck. Z gasped, fell and took Pauline down into the stands. Drod tried to stop them but was too slow. Sugi, who held her action, shot lightning at Radio which hit for a good amount of damage. Radio swung down and knocked Atrepos out. His physical form was replaced with a book as he found himself in the realm where he came from. He spoke with another Mayar who asked what happened to him. It said another fate watched over Z because she was not of this world. The light disappear. In the physical realm Drod jumped down to rescue Pauline and Daisy. He picked Pauline and Daisy up, and tried to get them out of the stands. Sugi took aim at Radio and shot which hit and destroyed the mech suit. Sugi ran over and cast mending on the book which caused Atropos to reappear. The one remaining person in the theater stood up and walked toward the group by Radio. She asked Atrepos “why did you do this brother? You need to dispatch whose strings are taught.” The being said it was his sister and the arbiter of the present. The woman said that she would have to call in a favor to make it right. She also called Sugi an arbiter of the Golden Ones and said her name was Verdandi. Sugi and Maxi tried to revive Expla. Drod tried to bind Z in this realm but she reached up and broke the staff. Drod questioned Z who said that her home world was full of boundary breakers and called it the Patchwork World of Tresigaia. She was from a country that worshiped playing games. Drod went to get help from Verdandi. While that happened Verdandi fused with Atrepos which allowed him to see the multiple futures then one possibility where Expla had golden eyes. Atrepos convinced Sugi to try and heal Expla which worked. Sugi began to radiate heat but it healed Expla back to life. Expla sat up and frantically looked around for Radio. She sat up and then bound over to Radio as it was in Atropos’ vision. Verdandi said that they were uperating on different wave lengths. Atrepos said that he had not operated in the restrained way that he did. Verdandi said this was becasue the world was broken and to get back they would have to fix this world completely. Drod confronted Verdandi about why she would want Willard to be killed. At that time Willard and Rose, screamed and jumped out of the box. Simultaneously, Judah stood up, used metal threads to reconstruct his body and began to attack. Atrepos used heal wounds on Z which helped to stop the worst bleeding. Maxi was in the box investigating things when Judah stood up. The Golem ran up and held Judah to the best of its ability. Maxi cast Lightning Bolt which did 29 damage. Inside Judah was a spider like construct with a cannon on top of it. They heard the familiar voice of Drod. He said that Judah was safe and sound back in Lornas. He said that he would be seeing them all very soon. Ace recovered from fainting when Judah got his neck snapped. Z said that she did not tell us because she did not know who the sleeper agent was or that they would believe her anyway. Maxi reached into the Golem; Z told Lucy to give her the core sliver and the Golem did so. The Golem asked if Zeelan was fine and Z dismissed Lucy. Zeelan said that Lucy was her Idelon. Z said that Fizalo Fizdizzleman came to Sergaia from her world. Z said that the goblins’ grandmother was a boundry breaker like her so she took them under her wing and promised to show them how to use the gift. With the fight concluded Z caught up the party. She said that Drod needed to get a real rod of anchoring. She said that Verdandi and Z worked on a way to anchor Castle Quarterstone in this world. Thirdly, she said that their friend that was forged could be saved. At that moment three fancy Warforged landed and dispatched birds, followed by many more forged. The tallest one, Dimitris, addressed Sugi and asked what happened. Sugi said that no one needed to be detained or executed. Two Forged went into the stands to secure Judah’s form. D asked Sugi why her body was golden and she told him of Kronotus and his fight against Kaldraccus. The Triumverate ushered the Party out of the area and back to the Frizdizzleman Estate. Sugi shook D’s hand and it mutated first his hand then his whole body. D panicked and chopped his own arm off. From the arm more metal built out a new construct of D in golden form. The being was Kronotus in human form. He said that they had to draw the lines of war and awaken the Golden Children. They had to take the battle to Kaldraccus.
