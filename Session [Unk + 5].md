## Session Notes
### Int. The Royal Palace of Turnsprock, Turnsprock - A Few Hours Later (Early Morning)
Kronotus addressed the assembled high nobility of Turnsprock. K said that this time it was different: their mother was gone, the guard rails were off, he would fight until Kaldraccus was no more.
