## Events from Last Session
* The Party spent a restless night at Ms. Bella’s in the Slum District of the Undercity of Turnsprock in Aranas.
* Miz/Val investigated Missy’s regenerative abilities and found out that she was 60% fungal pudding. They also learned a bit more about the Company woman who visited Missy the other day.
* Early in the morning, the Party reanimated Freddy’s severed head. We found out that Freddy did not know the Gith woman, that Frida was safe in a dungeon, that he was not involved in the assassination plot against Willard Wise and he thought that a usurper likely hired them.
* In the morning, Pauline found the Party, introduced herself and said that she would be observing Drod.
* The Party reunited at the bar at Ms. Bellas to begin their day proper.
* Maxi found that the fire familiar she summoned the previous day did not disappear and that it was likely her familiar.
* Atropos and Netta had a long, productive conversation about using their sheers and how to edge.
* After breakfast Verkatti took the Party to Largo’s house to potentially find Expa and Radio.
* Largo told the Party how to disable the mech suit and that the twins were staying with Z in the upper city.
* The Party convinced Largo and Djarko to take a trip to Matia for a few days.
* The Party went to find Expa and Radio with a plan to lure them away from Z by convincing them that we kidnapped their grandfather.
* The Party split into two groups with Miz/Val and Atrepos in Team Sneaky Sneak and Drod, Maxi and Sugi in Team Faux Ransom Negotiations.
* Team Ransom Negotiations passed a message up to Expa and Radio that their grandfather was waiting from them in a meeting room of the inn.
* Team Sneaky Sneak went up to the (hopefully) vacated room but found Z was still there.
* Team Ransom Negotiations confronted the Goblin twins and mostly subdued 
* Team Sneaky Sneak broke into the room to find Z still inside. Miz took a bite from an apple (a component of Z’s spell) then the three fought.
* Miz banished Z back to her home plane for one minute which allowed them to disable the Goblin’s mech suit (which was in the room.)
* Concurrently Drod drew up a contract that would force the twins to serve the Party in exchange for the release of their family.
* Before the Goblins signed, Z grabbed Expa and took her into another plane of existence but left Radio behind.
* Radio signed the contract from himself but also Expa and thus agreed to help the Party.
* After that, the Party reunited and Açi summoned them all to the Frizdizzleman Estate.
* Once there we reunited with Açi, Willard and Judah but lost Radio.
* Atropos observed that Willard’s fate was unusual and kinked; he was unsure if Willard would live or die in the coming days.
* Açi summoned the Needlepoint Guild (a group of assassins in the city with access to the platinum thread needed by Z to complete her golem.)
* Lady Daniella eventually realized that half of her supply of platinum thread was missing (presumably stolen by Z).
* Lady Daniella offered her support to our protection of Willard and wanted to personally confront Z for her theft.
* The Party discussed plans then took a long rest to finish the session.
