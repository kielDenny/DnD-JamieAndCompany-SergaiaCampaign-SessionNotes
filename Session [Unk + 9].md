# Session Notes
## Summary
The session began in the Holy City of Matia. The Party (plus Tharin the Eldarin man and “Blitzen”/Samuel the human from the Realm of Thought.) The Party did some light shopping in the massive market district of the city. A few of the Party’s members picked up enchanted items before their imminent return to the more limited markets of Turnsprock.

The Party’s shopping excursion became distracted by a demonstration in the main market square. They met a sect of undulating, scantily clad worshipers of a doomsday cult led by a human named Jardack-Ra. Valafair convinced Jardack-Ra to join the Party and to become the barer of Atropos’ book. 

Meanwhile, Pauline and Drod attempted to infiltrate the *Golden Chosen of Jardack-Ra*. When one of the members named Dodger tried to proposition Pauline to have sex, Drod took that personally and took revenge on Dodger. They followed him (along with Jardack-Ra) back to the headquarters of the Golden Chosen and did a little evocation magic on poor Dodger. After that, the Party used Jardack-Ra’s cult to procure several lavish carriages which took them back to the city of Turnsprock in Aranis. 

The Party came to the Frizdizzleman Estate late in the day. They found a full house waiting their arrival. Several of the past allies of the Party including Othwin, Zash and Melchior (the Wind god) greeted them. The Party arrived just as Willard, Rosie, Selica and Ace were to depart for Lornas. They talked for a little while and wished everyone safe travels.

When Othwin asked where his old friend Tharin was, they realized that Tharin had disappeared. Blitzen admitted that he saw Tharin jump off about an hour ago but didn’t say anything. Maxi used a powerful spell to transcend her body and ask the Eldarin Goddess of Chance, Samara, where Tharin was. Samara said that he was headed to the facility at Glemaris. This alarmed Othwin who knew that the now vacant facility would give Tharin near god powers within its walls. He implored the Party to go after Tharin and stop him.

Through Maxi’s communion with Samara, the Party also learned of a group to the east threatening Yanari Yanmas. Samara said that this group needed to be stopped. However, it was in the opposite direction of Tharin and the Party would have to make some tough decisions. However, they collectively decided to spend a day to rest and recover after their long travels.

As they had a little down time, Jardack-Ra wanted to cast Scrying to keep an eye on Tharin but didn’t have a gem worth 1,000 gold for the spell. Drod thought it would be an excellent opportunity to perform an experiment and offered up the blood ruby on his staff for the spell. When Jardack-Ra touched the staff, it immediately entered his mind and a battle of wills between the demon contained within, Morguinis, and Atropos ensued. After a pitched battle Atropos won but Morguinis marked Atropos’ sanctum with a red mark. As Atropos cast Morguinis out of Jardack-Ra, Drod’s staff flew across the courtyard, smashed against a tree and a small chip fell out of the blood ruby. When Drod picked up his staff again, the voice inside was quiet for the first time in a long time.

Because that little experiment had gone so well, Valithair got Drod to help out with another experiment. Val took the possum in his bag of holding to Drod’s carriage where they chained it up to the restraints inside. Val cast Animate Dead on the possum then place one of the Impure Philosopher’s Stones on the possum’s tale. It went from hissing to growling as it grew and grew in size. It soon burst out of its restraints and grew in size to be far larger than Drod’s carriage. As it snarled at Val and Drod, we ended the session for the night.


## Full Session Notes
### Ext. Matia, Market District - The Next Day
The Party began the session with some shopping in the Market District of Matia. As the Party walked, Valithair was the first to notice a large group of people gathered at the main market square. He noticed people wearing what looks looked like a cheap scepter hollowed and worn on the top of their heads. There were a few dozen people with these hats doing a weird rhythmic dance together. 

Drod recognized the behavior as being part of a doomsday cult. He told Pauline that this was fertile ground for harvesting and the two put together some plans.

Val asked a Tabaxi man who was handing out literature what was going on. The Tabaxi mentioned something about Riz which Val knew about. Val said to the Tabaxi that they should probably bow down to him instead of their leader but the Tabaxi just laughed. Val asked which way to this leader and the Tabaxi pointed further into the crowd. As Val walked on, the crowd started dancing and gyrating around Val but never actually touching him. 

Val came to a shoddily constructed podium at the crowd’s center. A man stood there postulating at the crowd. As Val approached, the man splashed oil on himself and postulated at the crowd. The man was decorated with dozens of crystals strung around his neck. 

He welcomed Val as his child to him. Val pulled a possum from his bag and cast animate dead on it; he commanded it to dance. The leader said his name was Jardack Man Ma Randa but he said he could be called Jardack-Ra. 

Val took Atropos’ book and handed it to Jardack-Ra. Jardack-Ra said that saw all of space and time at that moment. Jardack-Ra’s willpower was stronger than Atropos’ and Jardack-Ra didn’t become overwhelmed by it. Jardack-Ra said the book was the Akashic Records and that it was destined for him.

Upon hearing this, a voluptuous gnome woman approached Jardack’Ra and asked what the book meant. He said that it meant he was chosen. All of the apostles stripped naked, bowed then gyrated even more fervently. 

All of this gyrating drew a paladin of the City Guard who demanded to know what the cult members were doing. A Dragonbron member of the cult, who seemed to be Jardack’s lieutenant, declared an adjournment then more merriment tonight. The Human paladin came over to Jardack’Ra and told him that though the city was very tolerant, you can’t be doing demonstrations with nudity and talk of sexual acts. Jardack-Ra protested but as the crowd dispersed, the City Guardsman seemed satisfied and left. By this time, the rest of the Party caught up with Val and Jardack-Ra. 

As the only one who knew Atropos and after seeing him with the book, Sugi tested Jardack-Ra. She asked him to give her the book and Atropos came through him. Atropos said that because Jardack-Ra believed his ‘delusions’ he was an acceptable vessel for him. Sugi was a little off-put but accepted Atropos’ decision.

Pauline came forward and tried to convince Jardack-Ra that she wanted to join his movement. She convinced him that she aspired to ascent to the ‘Age of Acquires’ as the followers of Jardack-Ra aspire to and that she wants to be part of *The Golden Chosen of Jardacl-Ra.* He seemed to buy this and she bounded off with the other members of the cult as they dispersed.

After this, Val gave Jardack-Ra a medical examination “to see if they were in good condition.” He tried to see if the book was visibly connected to the man in the way that it was to the others. His molars are gold but other than that he looks like a normal Human man in probably his 40s. 

Sugi performed another experiment where she tried to take the book from Jardack-Ra. He willingly gave it away to Sugi. She touched a piece of the metal trim on the book which turned to Sugornite. She dramatically took out a pen, turned to the first page and tried to write her name on it but it spit the ink back on her face. It vanished from her hands and it appeared in Jardack-Ra’s thus proving that it was bonded to him.

Around that time Pauline returned to the group with some disturbing updates about Jardack-Ra’s group. Several members tried to get her to join their sex-ring. She protested and said that she was only 16 but this didn’t seem to stop them. Although icy as ever, Drod was incensed by this revelation. So Pauline, Drod and Jardack’Ra went to get a carriage and do something about the pedo-ring. They walked to a warehouse that served as the cult’s meeting place.

### Ext. The Golden Chosen of Jardick-Ra’s Headquarters - Shortly Later
They came to a dumpy-looking warehouse with several groups of people standing around, going in and out. There were about 30 people all total waiting for Jardick-Ra’s return. Drod ‘convinced’ Dodger (a Matthew McConaughey in *Dazed and Confused* type character) to ‘volunteer’ to ‘proselytize’ the Southlands Compnany folk down in Thoukarr (and became enslaved.) This seemed to be enough revenge for Drod and seeing that Pauline was safe he set about procuring a carriage for the Party. Jardack-Ra announced that he needed to go to Aranis and his followers provided three lavish carriages for the Party to use. So they returned to the rest of the Party still in the market district to let them know they were ready to go. After that, the Party hopped in the carriages and made their way to Aranis.

### Ext. The Main City Gate, Turnsprock, Aranis - Several Days Later
The Party plus Blitzen and Tharin arrived in Turnsprock. There was a little bit of commotion at the main gate as the Forged guards were reluctant to let Jardack-Ra’s followers inside. Sugi was powered-down so she was not able to help but the Party successfully convinced them that it was the will of the Opus. They continued on their way to the Fizdizzleman Estate.


### Ext. The Frizdizzleman Estate - Continuous
When they arrived, the Party noticed that Val’s two vassals are up, about and healed from their injuries. They also noticed more people than were here before. Othwin came up to the group and apologized for acting without speaking to the group but he invited some of the people from the Party’s past to help them. They noticed Zash, Melchior (the Zephyr), Shea, Lyda, Ace, Willard Wise, Selica and Rose. 

Ace, Willard, Selica and Rosie were set to depart now that Selica was fully trained by Othwin. The Party wished them well, especially Drod who said that he would come to visit them in Lornas soon enough.

As the attention turned back to Othwin, he asked where his friend was. The Party quickly realized that Tharin was gone. They panicked and tried to find out where Tharin could have gone. 

Maxi used a spell to transcend her body and call to a divine being of the Eldarin. The god said that she had not been spoken to in a very long time. She said that her name was Samara the goddess of chance. Samara said that Tharin was likely headed to the north to the facility to the northwest which was empty and desired to have a ruler again. Samara said that he will find information that neither Maxi nor Othwin nor Tharin would like. 

She also said that Maxi’s time in Sergaia was an anomaly. Maxi would have one chance to return home after the cracks in the sky healed or she would be stuck here for the rest of her days. 

The last bit of information Samara offered was that there is another group just like Maxi’s party, a crew of misfits, that saw the cracking in the sky as an opportunity to take advantage of as many people as possible. They are to the east in Asmary threatening Yanari Yanmas (Leyf’s cousin), in the village of Half Hill. Samara said that this group must be stopped. After that Maxi returned to her body to find the rest of the Party eagerly awaiting the result (which she relayed.)

With that bit of information, Othwin said that Glemaris was where the Party originally found the book and Teller (the same facility where the Monster Trio were hiding out northeast of Quarterstone.) He said that anyone could bend the power of the facility to their will and that they would have powers similar to a god within it. It could do irreparable harm to Sergaia.

From the corner of his eye, Jardick-Ra noticed a mechanical bird that did not appear to be like the others that flittered around the city. He cast Misty Step and grabbed it. A brownish-black oil began pouring out of its mouth as metal threads poked into his hound. It tried to lure or convince him to join the creed. Jardick-Ra threw it to the ground and stomped on it which broke it. *(It seemed like it was one of Kaldraccus’ followers’ creatures, possibly a work of Alexi Fulger or Orn Nanan-Varack.)*

After the commotion died down, Val asked McGuffin to fashion a prison cell in the estate. He said that he could probably make that work but it would take time.

Around that time Miz’s vassals returned to him with results from their interrogation of Blitzen. They said Blitzen’s real name was Samuel. Samuel said that the strange one (Tharin) hopped off the carriage and began to walk to north about an hour before the Party came to the city. This set the Party into motion to find Tharin befoe he got too far.

Drod and Jardack-Ra performed a little experiment. Jardick’Ra wanted to cast Skry to find Tharin but needed a gem worth at least 1,000 gold to use for the spell. Drod volunteered the blood ruby atop his staff and threw it toward the unsuspecting Jardack-Ra.

When he caught the staff, it triggered a battle of wills inside Jardack-Ra’s mind. The demon in Drod’s staff said that it was the Blood God that had been shackled to Drod for years and years; it needed a new body to get back to its formal self. Eventually, the Blood God said that his name was Morguinis.

Morguinis tried to attack Atropos but it missed; Atropos attacked back, landing three blows with Divine Smite for a ton of damage. Morguinis’ masked face appeared cracked and stood back up. He shattered the mask to reveal a skull-like visage beneath it. He rushed forward and landed two blows against Atropos. Atropos swung for three more shots and landed two. The attacks flung the demon back, it ran back at Atropos (although it looked hurt) and made a claw attack at Atropos’ face. Morguinis’ blow landed and Atropos failed a constitution save. Morguinis it was too weak to finish him off but he would be waiting for him. After that Morguinis returned to Drod’s staff. Atropos looked around the realm of the soul; it looked as it should except for a new fleck of red in the top corner which would not go away. 

Outside of Jardack-Ra’s mind, Drod’s staff flew from Jardack-Ra’s hands. Drod picked up the staff and noticed a chip of the ruby fell out which faded from red into gray and dissolved. For the first time in a long time, the staff did not talk with Drod for the rest of the day.

Val had another experiment to run with Drod’s help. Together, they walked (accompanied by Val’s servants) back to Drod’s carriage. When they arrived, Val produced the dead possum he kept in his bag of holding. Drod shackled the stiff creature with a metal collar to the restraints inside of his carriage. When they were sufficiently happy with the restraints, Val reanimated the corpse then slipped a Philosopher Stone Ring on the creature’s tail. The creature hissed and then barked and growled as it grew and grew. It grew so large that it broke the steel collar and burst out of Drod’s carriage. On this note we wrapped the session so that everyone could partake in whatever comes next.
